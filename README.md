# To install & run it on your own:
## Update configuration files
First of all, make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
Next up, edit the `keys.js` and `monitor.js` files in the **configuration** folder.

## Install all dependencies
Next up, run `npm install`. That will install all the depencies you need for this to work. If you get any errors, you likely don't have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) installed or you don't have it installed properly.

## Running
Now, run `npm start`, that will start the monitor!
